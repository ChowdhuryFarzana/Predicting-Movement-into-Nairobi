# Predicting-Movement-into-Nairobi
The project is about creating a predictive model using traffic data provided from Uber Movement and historic bus ticket sales data from Mobiticket. The project predicts the number of tickets, and the time of the day the ticket sold the most for buses into Nairobi from cities in "up country" Kenya.
